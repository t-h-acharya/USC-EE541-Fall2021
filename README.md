# USC-EE541-Fall2021

This repository contains my solutions to problem sets for EE541: A Computational Introduction to Deep Learning at the University of Southern California (USC) for the Fall 2021 semester. The course, taught by Prof. Brandon Franzke, covers topics such as linear regression, recurrent neural
networks, scikit‚Äêlearn, PyTorch, and more.
